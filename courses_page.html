<p id="nam"><b>While some prefer the artistic and creative side of web development, others are drawn to the technical one. 
    There’s a third group of people who are masters of both these aspects. The first group is that of front-end developers,
     the second is of back-end developers, and the third that of full-stack developers
    Most modern web applications today require over 20 different job functions and developers who can navigate these various 
    functions across the stack are highly valuable. Full-stack developers are always in vogue and much sought after both in
     startups as well as leading enterprises owing to their versatility, ability to step in and troubleshoot areas across the 
     technology ecosystem that goes into building a winning product, and their contribution to speed and cost-effectiveness.  
    From mobile-first strategies, product testing through MVP (minimum viable product) cycles, app development, and creating 
    exceptional UI/UX, a full-stack developer enables it all. Before we dive into everything you’ll have going for you once 
    you become a skilled full-stack developer, let’s understand what a full-stack is and what a full-stack developer actually does.
     A FULL-STACK DEVELOPER designs and builds dynamic data-driven websites and applications using a rich ensemble of 
     technologies, techniques and workflows that serve both the end user and the back-end infrastructure.
     The word ‘stack’ simply refers to an amalgamation of technologies and products that form the technical ecosystem and 
     backbone needed to build and operate the product
     A stack is typically made up of a database such as MongoDB, MySQL, and others, an application framework such 
     as Express, Rails or Laravel, a platform or runtime such as Node.js, PHP or Ruby and a client-side web application
      framework such as React, Angular or Vue. Depending on the project requirement, different kinds of stacks like MEAN, MERN, LAMP stack, Ruby on Rails, 
      and many other stacks are required and used.
     Full-Stack Developers are Jacks of multiple trades, handling both the front-end and the back-end,
      including servers, databases, and even clients. A Full-Stack Developer must be able to work with all the components
       of a stack to ensure they work together efficiently.</b></p>
       <p><h3>5 Reasons To Learn Full-stack</h3></p>
       <h2>1. Full-Stack Development opens multi-faceted scope for growth</h2>
       <p id="nam">Companies are no longer in pursuit of specialists in software development. The preference is towards full-stack developers who are multi-faceted and cultivate a mindset to constantly upskill themselves.

        There is huge scope for accelerated growth as companies resort to this broad skillset that brings in speed and cost-effectiveness for their businesses. Full-stack developers boast of a fast-tracked, multi-dimensional career growth across companies ranging across globally valued end-to-end enterprise solutions and startups.
        
        Full-stack engineers typically begin their careers as front-end or back-end developers at the entry-level, quickly moving up ranks as they perfect their technical skills. Practice-oriented bootcamps that provide you work-like experience can help you master every aspect of development and get you industry ready in a relatively short time and are a great alternative to this.</p>
<h2>2.Full-Stack Development is one of the highest paid jobs</h2>
        <p id="nam">Full-stack development is one of the highest-paid jobs across the globe due to its impact on business and marketing. This versatile approach to development helps organizations distinguish themselves and catalyses revenue growth.

            According to ZipRecruiter, the average salary of an entry-level full-stack developer is $58,040 annually in the US. For mid-level developers, it is $97,500 a year, and $116,504 for experienced ones. Even Indeed points out that the average annual salary figure sits at $113,462 a year in the US, and between £40,000 - £70,000 in the UK.
            
            This high salary is because full-stack developers can work with any aspect of software development, from back-end programming to front-end design. They can create and maintain both websites and applications. They also have experience with server administration and infrastructure, which allows them to manage everything from data storage to user authentication.  
            
            While full-stack programming is one of the most rewarding tech jobs, the remuneration of a full-stack developer depends on factors such as core skills, additional skills (databases, UI/UX basics, etc.), and the location of the organization, demographics, and experience.</p>
    <h2>3. Full-Stack Development enables rapid project delivery</h2>
    <p id="nam">Tasks related to integration, updates, front-end, and back-end coordination, and meeting client expectations—all fall within the scope of a full-stack developer role. Not only does this help in lowering the dependencies on other teams—which often delays execution—it speeds up the development cycle and brings in cost efficiencies.

        If you’re a full-stack developer, you also need to be well versed with the Agile Project Management (APM) framework, Scrum, and its building blocks. The job profile also mandates effective communication with team members to streamline development processes.
        
        A full-stack developer learns to deliver results quickly with a toolkit that constitutes the most efficient tools in the industry, enabling smart and fast work.</p>
        <h2>4. Full-Stack development is all about building versatility</h2>
        <p id="nam">A full-stack developer is a one-stop-solution of sorts for companies. The onus of handling different stages of the project right from initiating the project, basic level of development, key project contributions both on front-end and back-end, as well as managing the UI/UX as per client feedback falls on the full-stack developer. This gives them great responsibility, dependability, and credit for successful project execution.

            Full stack developers, with their multi-dimensional skillset are equipped to step in anywhere across the development spectrum to provide an end-to-end solution. Tech companies appreciate and value them for their versatility across the stack, which translates to speed to market.
            
            Learning full-stack development will help you master a wide set of skills ranging from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, back-end languages (Python, PHP, Ruby), database storage, HTTP, REST, and NPM, along with a good set of Agile project management and soft skills.</p>
    <h2>5. With greater productivity comes greater responsibility</h2>
    <p id="nam">Full-stack developers get to work with the client-side as well as the server-side of the application. This gives the developer more control over the product and makes way for far more creative flexibility. The ability to see the big picture empowers full-stack developers to make decisions faster, giving them an edge over other developers.

        The broad range of skills across the stack and the creative liberty coupled with good judgment skills is what increases the overall productivity of full-stack developers, empowering them to be self-reliant and move the needle on the development better and faster. Moreover, some companies offer pay after placement training for aspiring full-stack developers to gain practical experience and improve their skill set without having to worry about the financial burden upfront.</p>
